# Capstone Project 4 - Use a Public API
The goal of this project is to create a dynamic and interactive website using the Express/Node.js platform that integrates and interacts with a public API. The project is designed to enhance understanding of server-side programming, client-server communication, and API integration. By utilizing the Axios HTTP client, data will be retrieved from a chosen public API and presented in a user-friendly manner on the website. It will also involve implementing error handling and ensuring that the application is robust and provides a good user experience.
