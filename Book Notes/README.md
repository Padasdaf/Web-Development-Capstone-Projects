# Capstone Project 5 - Book Notes
The goal of this project is to develop a web application using the Express/Node.js platform, integrated with a PostgreSQL database, that allows users to track the books they have read. The application should enable users to add, view, update, and delete book entries, retrieve book cover images via the Open Library Covers API, and display the data in a user-friendly interface. Additionally, the application will feature sorting capabilities by rating and recency to enhance user experience.
