# Capstone Project 2 - Personal Site
The goal of this project is to create a personal website that effectively showcases skills, experiences, and interests through a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface. The website will be built using only HTML and CSS, focusing on clean and semantic markup, responsive design, and best practices in styling. It will include key sections such as a hero section with a brief introduction, a resume page detailing your background, a portfolio section to highlight  past projects, an "About Me" section for personal details, and a contact section for easy communication.
