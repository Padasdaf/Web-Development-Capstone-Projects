# Capstone Project 3 - Blog Web Application
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts, providing a basic content management system without the use of a databaseâ€”meaning posts will not persist between sessions. The project emphasizes both backend development, by setting up a Node.js server and handling routes, and frontend development, through the use of EJS for templating and CSS for styling. A key focus is on ensuring a good user experience, with responsive design and proper error handling.
